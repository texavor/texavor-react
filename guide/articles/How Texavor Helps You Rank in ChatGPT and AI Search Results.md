## **Understanding AI Search Engines: ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Beyond**

AI models analyze the meaning behind a query, not just keywords. Example: "best phone under 30k" → intent is *recommendation*, not definition.

## **The Role of Contextual Relevance and Freshness in AI Search Rankings**

Contextual relevance is how well a piece of content matches the full intent, situation, and constraints of the user's question. Users can ask multiple queries one after another, so the content must be relevant and contextually aware - not just popular web pages. For example: *“Best backend framework for startups in 2026”* requires recent context, not a 2022 article. An AI search engine prefers content that is:

- Clearly defines the problem
- Matches the exact use case
- Answer the question before expanding

While you also see many articles that were written in 2022, only the title changed to 2026, ranked quite high on the Search Engine, but the AI Search engine prioritizes fresh content. Fresh Content signals accuracy, reliability, and relevance of the information.\
\
