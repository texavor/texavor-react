# Strategic Hybrid Marketing & UI Plan (SEO + GEO)

Based on user feedback and 2026 market trends, we will shift from a pure "GEO" focus to a **Hybrid SEO & AI-Visibility** positioning. This acknowledges that traditional SEO isn't dead—it's the fuel that AI engines (GEO) use to find and cite your content.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Messaging & Positioning (Landing Page)

Summary: Shift the narrative from "GEO Era" to "AI Visibility & Citations."

#### [MODIFY] Hero Section

- **Current Headline:** "GEO era" or "Authority Engine"
- **Proposed Headline:** "Rank in Google. Get Cited by ChatGPT."
- **Sub-headline:** "Traditional SEO gets you found. Texavor's AI-Visibility Engine gets you cited. Ensure your brand is the first source AI engines recommend to your customers."

#### [NEW] Trust & Social Proof

- **Stats Banner:** Use data from `/api/v1/public/stats` (e.g., "5,000+ Articles Analyzed", "Average Content Score: 85%").
- **Case Study Section:** "The Anatomy of a Citation" — Show a side-by-side comparison of a "Generic AI post" vs a "Texavor Optimized Post" with highlighted entities and schema.

### 2. Marketing Strategy & Keywords

Summary: Targeting users who need to maintain Google rankings while winning the AI search game.

#### Target Audience

- **The "Modern SEO" Marketer:** People who know the rules are changing but still need their WordPress/SaaS sites to rank in search results.
- **The "Direct Benefit" Founder:** Wants to ensure their brand appears when users ask "What is the best [product category]?" in ChatGPT.
- **AI-Native Brands:** Startups that want to bypass traditional backlink-heavy SEO by focusing on semantic trust and citations.

#### Keywords to Win (Hybrid Strategy)

- **Traditional + AI:** "AI SEO strategy 2026," "How to rank in AI search," "Google SGE optimization."
- **Problem-Solving:** "Fix declining organic traffic," "ChatGPT visibility for brands," "AI citation tools."
- **The "Bridge" Terms:** "Contextual SEO," "Semantic Authority," "LLM Optimization."

### 3. Technical & UI Fixes

Summary: Remove friction from the conversion funnel.

#### [MODIFY] Mobile Optimization

- Fix the signup page layout for mobile devices (as discovery happens on Reddit/X mobile).

#### [MODIFY] UI Cleanliness

- Move away from "AI-generated" aesthetics (pure gradients/magic icons) to a more "Scientific Analysis" look (tables, density maps, entity graphs).

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification

- **Landing Page Clarity:** Run a "5-second test" with a user to see if the value prop ("Get cited by ChatGPT") is clear.
- **Mobile Funnel Check:** Test the signup flow on iOS/Android browsers.
- **Keyword Performance:** Monitor search console for "AI Visibility" related terms after updating meta descriptions.
