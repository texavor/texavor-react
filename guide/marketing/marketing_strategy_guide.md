# Texavor: Marketing & Messaging Strategy Guide

This guide defines how we talk about Texavor to bridge the "trust deficit" and clarify our value proposition in the hybrid search era.

---

## 1. The Core Positioning: "Hybrid Search Visibility"

We are moving away from vague terms like "Authority Engine" and abstract "GEO" branding. Our new core value prop is the bridge between traditional search and AI answers.

**Primary Pitch:**

> "Rank in Google. Get Cited by ChatGPT."

**Why this works:**

- It respects the user's current need for traditional SEO.
- It promises a future-proof "upgrade" (GEO) that competitors aren't offering clearly.
- It is benefit-driven, not feature-driven.

---

## 2. Key Messaging Pillars

### A. "SEO is the Foundation, GEO is the Edge"

Messaging should emphasize that you can't have one without the other. You need high-quality, indexable content (SEO) for AI engines to discover and cite you (GEO).

- **Tagline:** Master the Hybrid Era.

### B. "Direct Brand Citations"

Instead of "Visibility," talk about **Citations**. This is a concrete unit of value.

- **Benefit:** When a user asks an AI agent for a recommendation, _your brand_ is the one it quotes.

### C. "Evidence-Based Writing"

Position our tools as an "AI-Analyst" for the writer. We aren't a content spinner; we are the technical engine that ensures your content meets the strict trust standards of LLMs.

## 3. Recommended Terminology (The "Say This, Not That" List)

| ❌ Avoid (Too Vague) | ✅ Use Instead (Direct Benefit)            |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Authority Engine     | AI-Visibility Engine / Citation Engine     |
| GEO Optimization     | Get cited by ChatGPT / AI Search Mastery   |
| AEO Analysis         | Citation Audit / Trust Analysis            |
| Content Spinner      | Scientific Research & Writing Exoskeleton  |
| AI Visibility Score  | Citation Potential / Brand Authority Score |

## 4. Target Audiences & Their "Hooks"

### 1. The Modern SEO Professional

- **The Hook:** "Don't let SGE kill your traffic. Add a GEO layer to your existing SEO strategy."
- **Focus:** Technical correctness, schema, and keywords like **"How to rank in AI search"** (550k searches/mo) and **"Google SGE optimization"** (33k searches/mo).

### 2. The Early-Stage Founder

- **The Hook:** "Bypass the backlink war. Win citations from Perplexity by becoming the most 'trusted' entity in your niche."
- **Focus:** Fast results, branding, and appearing as the recommended solution in AI chats. Target high-opportunity terms like **"get cited by chatgpt"** (1.9k searches/mo, Difficulty: 38).

## 5. Trust Deficit Fixes (Social Proof Strategy)

To overcome the "skepticism" identified in feedback, all marketing surfaces should include:

1.  **Concrete Data:** "85% Average Content Score across 5k+ analyzed articles."
2.  **Visible Analysis:** Show screenshots of our "Entity Graphs" or "Citation Scanners" to prove we are doing deep work.
3.  **The "Citation Anatomy":** Use the [Case Study](anatomy_of_a_citation.md) to show how we optimize specific entities and schemas.

## 6. Content Distribution Hook

When promoting on Reddit/X (where discovery happens on mobile):

- **Hook:** "I analyzed 100 articles that got cited by Perplexity. Here is the exact schema they used (and how we automated it)."
- **Link:** Direct them to a tool result or a public case study page.
