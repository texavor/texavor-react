**Rank for Prompts, not just Keywords.**

Traditional SEO tools tell you how many people search for a term. Texavor's **AI Visibility** tells you how likely an AI agent is to **cite your content** when answering that user's question.

## 1. The Metric: AI Visibility Score

We calculate a score (0-10) based on 4 "Generative" signals:

1.  **Question Intent (40%):** Is this a direct question (e.g., _"How do I restart a Kubernetes pod?"_)? AI models prioritize these.
2.  **Topical Authority (30%):** Do you have enough content depth to be considered an expert here?
3.  **Competition (20%):** Are there already "Grounding Sources" (like Wikipedia/MDN) dominating the answer?
4.  **Format Fit (10%):** Does the keyword demand a "List" or "Tutorial"?

### The Radar Chart

- **Answer Fit:** How well does the content shape match the query?
- **Context Depth:** Do you need long-form or short-form?
- **Trust Signal:** How heavily does the AI weight "Brand Authority"?

## 2. Feature: "Prompt Research" Mode

Users don't just type "shoes" anymore. They type complex prompts into Claude and ChatGPT.

**How to find "Prompt Opportunities":**

1.  Go to **Research** > **Keyword Monitor**.
2.  Enter a Topic (e.g., "Vector Databases").
3.  **Toggle:** **"Prompt Mode"**.

We query search suggestion APIs to find the _Long-Tail Questions_ that map to User Prompts.

- ❌ **Keyword:** "vector database"
- ✅ **Prompt Opportunity:** "vector database vs relational database for rag applications"

## 3. The New Workflow

Stop chasing high-volume, low-intent keywords.

1.  **Step 1:** Filter for **Questions** (Why/How/What).
2.  **Step 2:** Sort by **AI Visibility Score** (High to Low).
3.  **Step 3:** Select a term with _Medium Volume_ but _High Visibility Potential_.
4.  **Step 4:** Click **"Create GEO Outline"** to target that specific question.

## Legacy Metrics (Classic SEO)

We still provide the standard data for your Hybrid Strategy:

- **Volume:** Monthly searches.
- **Difficulty:** Backlink competition.
- **CPC:** Commercial intent proxy.

Use these to validate traffic potential, but use **AI Visibility** to validate _ranking probability_.
