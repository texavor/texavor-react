Texavor is different from traditional CMSs. We don't just manage files; we manage **Authority Signals**. Here are the concepts you need to know.

## 1. Visualizing "AI Visibility"

**The Old World (SEO):** You ranked for keywords.
**The New World (GEO):** You rank for _Answers_.

When a user asks ChatGPT _"What is the best way to handle state in React?"_, the AI constructs an answer based on its training data and real-time RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation).

**Texavor's AI Visibility Score** measures:

- **Trust Signal:** Does the AI recognize you as an entity?
- **Answer Fit:** Is your content structured as a direct answer?
- **Legibility:** Can the AI parse your HTML easily?

We help you move from "Invisible" to "Top Citation".

## 2. Fighting "Content Decay"

AI models prioritize fresh, accurate information. If your "React Tutorial" references version 16, ChatGPT will ignore it for version 19 queries.

**The Freshness Guard:**
We don't just check the date. We ask an LLM: _"Is the information in this article still semantically valid today?"_

- **Evergreen Score:** High score means safe to leave alone.
- **Decay Risk:** High risk triggers an alert to update your content immediately.

## 3. The "Orchestration" Layer

You shouldn't be copy-pasting Markdown between your blog, Dev.to, and Medium.

**Texavor is your Source of Truth.**

1.  Write once in Texavor.
2.  **Deploy** to all platforms.
3.  We handle the `rel=canonical` tags so Google knows the original source is _your domain_, even if the content goes viral on Medium.

## 4. E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)

AI Agents look for "Human Signals" to verify truth.

**Unified Author Profile:**
Texavor syncs your bio across all platforms. When an AI sees the same Author Name + Bio on Dev.to and your Personal Blog, it reinforces your entity graph, making you a "Trusted Source".
