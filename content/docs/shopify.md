# Shopify Integration

**Blog posts are cheaper than Instagram Ads.**

Texavor connects to your Shopify store to help you publish "Money Pages"—guides, comparisons, and stories that rank on Google and drive free traffic to your products.

## Features

- **Product Embedding:** Easily link to your products.
- **Multiple Blogs:** Choose between your "News", "Guides", or any other blog handle you created in Shopify.
- **SEO Meta Sync:** We sync your Title Tag and Meta Description directly to Shopify's SEO fields.

## 1. Connect via OAuth

We use the secure Shopify App Protocol. You do **not** need to create a Private App anymore.

1.  Navigate to **Integrations**.
2.  Click **Connect** on the Shopify card.
3.  **Shop Domain:** Enter your `myshopify.com` domain (e.g., `suraj-store.myshopify.com`).
4.  **Shopify Blog:** Enter the handle of the blog you want to post to (default is `news`).
5.  Click **Redirects to Shopify**.
6.  You will be taken to your Shopify Admin to approve the "Texavor" app.
7.  Once approved, you will be redirected back to Texavor.

## 2. Publishing Workflow

When you click **Deploy**:

1.  Select **[x] Shopify**.
2.  **Blog:** Confirm the destination blog (e.g., "News").
3.  **Handle:** (Optional) Customize the URL ending.
4.  **Tags:** Tags will appear as Shopify Blog Tags (useful for filtering on your storefront).

## FAQ

**Q: Can I embed products?**
A: Yes. In Texavor, paste your product URL. We convert it into a standard link. Your Shopify Theme handles the rest.

**Q: Does it work with Headless Shopify?**
A: Yes, because we write to the Storefront API backend. Your headless frontend just needs to fetch the blog data as usual.
