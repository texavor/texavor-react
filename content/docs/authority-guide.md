**"Views" are a vanity metric.**

If 1,000 people view your page but 0 people trust you, you have failed.
Texavor measures **Authority Metrics**—metrics that track your dominance in the AI Knowledge Graph.

## 1. LLM Share of Voice (The "New Metric")

Traditional SEO tracks "Rank". We track **Mention Frequency**.

- **Definition:** "When a user asks GPT-5 about 'Best CRM for Startups', how often is your brand cited?"
- **The Chart:** A trend line showing your citation % vs competitors (HubSpot, Salesforce) over time.

## 2. Content Health (Freshness)

A stale blog is a liability. This metric tracks the _validity_ of your content.

- **Fresh (>90%):** Information is current (checked against live search results).
- **At Risk (50-89%):** Minor factual drift (e.g., pricing changed).
- **Decayed (<50%):** Obsolete. (e.g., "React Class Components").

**Action:** Click **"Refresh"** on any "At Risk" article to trigger an AI Update.

## 3. AI Visibility Score

For each article, we calculate:

- **Question Intent:** Does this answer a specific user query?
- **Format Utility:** Is it structured for direct extraction (Feature Snippets)?
- **Authority Fit:** Does it reinforce your core topic cluster?

## 4. Aggregated Traffic (The Basics)

We also pull standard data from your connected platforms via API:

- **Dev.to:** Views, Reactions.
- **Hashnode:** Views, Appreciations.
- **Medium:** Views, Reads (if token allows).

_Note: Traffic data relies on the platform's API availability._
