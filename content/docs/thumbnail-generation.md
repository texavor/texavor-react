**Developers ignore stock photos of "Business people shaking hands".**

Texavor's Visual Studio is tuned to generate **Technical Aesthetics**—Cyberpunk, Synthwave, Clean UI, and Minimalist Dark Mode visuals that appeal to engineers.

## 1. The "Code-Style" Generator

We use a specialized Stable Diffusion pipeline fine-tuned on:

- **Abstract Topology:** Connectivity graphs, nodes, and networks.
- **Terminal Aesthetic:** Green/Purple phosphor glows on dark backgrounds.
- **Isometric Architecture:** Cloud infrastructure diagrams.

**How to use:**

1.  Open Article.
2.  Click **"Generate Assets"**.
3.  Choose Style: `[ ] Minimal Dark` `[ ] Synthwave` `[ ] Sketch`.
4.  Result: A unique cover image that looks like it belongs on a Senior Engineer's blog.

## 2. Smart Brand Injection

AI images often look generic. We fix this by layering your **Brand Identity** _over_ the generation.

- **Logo Watermark:** We automatically place your logo in the corner (opacity adjustable).
- **Typography:** We overlay the Article Title using your brand font (e.g., _Inter_ or _Fira Code_).
- **Color Grading:** We apply a subtle tint filter matching your primary Hex code.

## 3. Beyond Thumbnails: Diagram Generation

_(Beta Feature)_

Texavor can turn text descriptions into **Mermaid.js** diagrams or simple architectural flowcharts.

1.  Highlight a step-by-step list in your editor.
2.  Click **"Visualize"**.
3.  We generate a clean flow-chart image representing the logic.

## 4. Open Graph (OG) Automation

When you deploy to Dev.to or share on Twitter, the "Preview Card" decides if people click.

- **Auto-Resize:** We generate 1200x630 (Facebook/LinkedIn) and 1000x420 (Dev.to) variants.
- **Text Readability:** We ensure the title is legible even on mobile screens.
