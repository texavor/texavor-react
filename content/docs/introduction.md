**Automated Authority. Built for the AI Era.**

Welcome to **Texavor** — the platform designed to help technical teams and thought leaders dominate the 2026 search landscape. We go beyond simple "AI writing" to help you engineer content that ranks on Google _and_ gets cited by AI agents like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity.

## Why Texavor?

Modern authority requires a dual strategy. Texavor is the platform to optimize for both **Classic SEO** (Google Search) and **Future GEO** (AI Chatbots).

- 🔍 **Dominate Search** - Traditional Keyword Research and SEO Analysis tools.
- 🤖 **Rank in AI Chatbots** - Measure and improve your "AI Visibility Score".
- 🛡️ **Guard Your Freshness** - Detect and fix "Content Decay" before LLMs stop citing you.
- ⚡ **Deploy Like Code** - Research, draft, and publish to Dev.to, Hashnode, Webflow, Wordpress, Shopify, Medium and Custom Webhooks in one workflow.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. The AI Visibility Engine (GEO)

Don't just guess if ChatGPT knows your brand. Measure it.

- **AI Visibility Score:** See exactly how well your content answers user prompts.
- **Prompt Research:** Discover the _exact questions_ users are asking AI about your niche.
- **Website Auditor:** Check if your robots.txt and Schema are blocking AI crawlers.

### 2. Strategic Content Intelligence

Move from "Keyword Stuffing" to "Topic Authority".

- **Competitor LLM Tracker:** See who the AIs consider the "Top Authority" in your field (and how to beat them).
- **Keyword Research v2:** Filter for high-intent questions that drive featured snippets.

### 3. Automated Content Operations

Eliminate the busywork of publishing.

- **AEO Outlines:** Generate outlines specifically structured for Answer Engine Optimization (Direct Answers, FAQ Schema).
- **Cross-Posting:** Publish to your own blog, Dev.to, and Medium simultaneously with canonical links handled automatically.
- **Asset Generation:** Auto-generate code-styled thumbnails that developers click.
