**Target keywords that AI can actually answer.**

Traditional tools only show "Volume" and "Difficulty". Texavor adds a crucial third dimension: **AI Visibility**.

## 1. The Interface

Enter a seed topic (e.g., `generative engine optimization`) to see a list of related terms.

### Key Metrics

- **Volume:** Monthly search volume.
- **CPC:** Cost Per Click (Commercial Intent proxy).
- **Difficulty (0-100):** How hard it is to rank on Google.
- **AI Visibility:** _The Texavor Advantage._

### Search Modes

The toggle next to the search bar controls the depth of analysis:

- **Basic:** Clarified it returns related keywords without metrics (fast brainstorming).
- **Detailed:** Confirmed this is where Volume/Difficulty/CPC live.
- **Prompt:** Kept as the "AI Visibility" mode.

## 2. AI Visibility Scores

This column tells you if an LLM is likely to surface your content.

- **⚠️ Traditional SEO (Red/Grey):**

  - _Score:_ < 4.0/10
  - _Meaning:_ AI answers this poorly or genericly. You need massive Domain Authority to rank.
  - _Action:_ approach with caution.

- **⚡ AI Friendly (Yellow/Green):**
  - _Score:_ > 5.0/10
  - _Meaning:_ This is a "Gap" in the Knowledge Graph. AI models are looking for structured data on this topic.
  - _Action:_ **High Priority.** Write this immediately.

## 3. Deep Analysis

Click the **View Analysis** button (or the eye icon) to open the Inspection Sidebar.
