**Don't brainstorm. Let Texavor find the holes in your topical authority.**

To dominate a niche (like "SaaS Marketing"), you don't just need _good_ articles. You need _complete coverage_. The Topic Generator scans the Knowledge Graph to find what you are missing.

## 1. Generating Ideas

1.  Enter a seed keyword (e.g., `Generative Engine Optimization`).
2.  Click **Submit**.
3.  The system returns a list of specific content angles:
    - **Guides:** Comprehensive "Pillar content".
    - **Comparisons:** "X vs Y" for decision makers.
    - **Analyses:** Deep dives into trends.

## 2. Topic Metrics

Expand any topic card to see the "Why This Topic?" analysis.

- **Difficulty (Gauge):** (0-10) How hard it is to rank. Lower is better.
- **Opportunity:** (0-10) A composite score of High Volume + Low Competition + High Relevance.
- **Authority Score:** Checks if this topic reinforces your existing content cluster.
- **GEO Score:** (Generative Engine Optimization) Checks if this topic is frequently cited by LLMs.

## 3. The "Why" Insights

For each suggestion, we provide:

- **Why This Topic?** e.g., _"SERP gaps show sparse research on GEO techniques."_
- **Unique Approach:** How you should frame your article to stand out (e.g., _"Focus on actionable steps for developers."_)
