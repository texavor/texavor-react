**To rank for "React", you must also cover "React State", "React Hooks", and "React Performance".**

Texavor's **Authority Detector** isn't a random idea generator. It scans your existing content map and suggests the _missing pieces_ required to complete your "Knowledge Graph".

## 1. How "Topical Authority" Works

AI Search (ChatGPT, Perplexity) views you as an Entity.
If you have 10 articles on "Database Migrations" but 0 on "Database Backups", the AI considers your authority "Incomplete" and is less likely to cite you as an expert.

**The Goal:** Complete the graph.

## 2. Using the Detector

1.  **Select a Pillar:** Enter a core topic (e.g., "Next.js").
2.  **Scan:** The AI analyzes the top 20 Semantic Concepts related to "Next.js".
3.  **Gap Analysis:** It checks _your_ blog to see which ones you are missing.

**Output Example:**

- ✅ Next.js Routing (You have this)
- ✅ Next.js SSR (You have this)
- ❌ **Next.js Middleware** (GAP DETECTED - High Priority)
- ❌ **Next.js Edge Functions** (GAP DETECTED - Medium Priority)

## 3. From Gap to Article

Once a gap is found:

1.  Click **"Fill Gap"**.
2.  Texavor immediately launches the **AEO Outline Generator** for that specific topic.
3.  It pre-fills the prompt with: _"Write a technical guide on Next.js Middleware to complete the topical authority for [Domain]."_

## 4. Modes

- **Gap Mode:** Find missing sub-topics (described above).
- **Trend Mode:** Find rising topics in your niche (e.g., "React 19 Alpha").
- **Question Mode:** Find specific long-tail questions your competitors haven't answered.
