# Copywriting Audit & Strategy: The "Texavor 2026" Pivot

**Current Alignment:**
Your current copy ("Build Authority. Not Just Articles.") is strong for _human_ readers and technical teams.
**The Gap:** It fails to address the _machine_ reader (LLMs). It doesn't convey the urgency of "Unseen by AI = Invisible to Users."

Here is my proposed copy strategy to market Texavor as the **First GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Platform.**

## 1. The Hero Section Rewrite

**Goal:** Shift from "Writing Tool" to "Survival Tool for the AI Era."

| Element           | Current                                                                                                 | **Proposed (Future-Proof)**                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Headline**      | Build Authority. Not Just Articles.                                                                     | **Don't Let AI Bury Your Brand.**                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Subhead**       | The command center for technical teams to research, write, and orchestrate content that actually ranks. | **The world's first GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) platform.** <br> Monitor your visibility in ChatGPT, fix "decayed" content before LLMs ignore it, and dominate the 2026 search landscape. |
| **Primary CTA**   | Get Started                                                                                             | **Test Your AI Visibility Score (Free)**                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Secondary CTA** | View Demo                                                                                               | **Start Free Trial**                                                                                                                                                                               |

**Why this works:** It triggers "Loss Aversion" (Don't get buried) and offers an immediate, curiosity-driven solution (Test Score).

## 2. Feature Positioning (The "New 5")

Map your new features to "Survival Instincts."

### Feature 1: The AI Visibility Monitor (was "Keyword Research")

- **Headline:** "Google is only 40% of the battle."
- **Body:** Traditional SEO tools ignore where 60% of devs search: ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. Texavor tracks your **LLM Share of Voice** alongside Google Rankings, so you know exactly who's recommending you.

### Feature 2: Content Freshness Guard (was "Freshness Monitor")

- **Headline:** "Stale Content is Invisible Content."
- **Body:** LLMs hallucinate when data is old. Our **Decay Risk Engine** scans your articles 24/7. When a topic evolves (e.g. "React 19 released"), we alert you to update _before_ the AIs stop citing you.

### Feature 3: Answer Engine Optimization (was "Outline Generator")

- **Headline:** "Write for Answers, Not Clicks."
- **Body:** Chatbots don't want 2,000-word fluff pieces. They want direct answers. Our **AEO Outline Generator** structures your content with "Answer Nodes" that LLMs love to ingest and cite.

---

## 3. The "Free Tool" Hook (For Viral Marketing)

To drive traffic to the landing page, rename the focus of the free tool.

- **Tool Name:** The "Will AI Rank You?" Test.
- **Headline:** "Will ChatGPT recommend your product... or your competitor's?"
- **Copy:** "Enter your keyword. In 10 seconds, get a comprehensive **AI Visibility Audit** revealing your Ranking Probability, Topic Authority, and Click Potential."
- **CTA:** "Get My Score Now"

---

## 4. Trust & Social Proof (E-E-A-T)

Keep your "Unified Author Identity" section but reframe it:

- **New Headline:** "Proof of Human."
- **New Body:** "In an ocean of AI slop, verified human authorship is the ultimate ranking signal. Texavor syncs your Author Biography across Dev.to, Medium, and your blog to prove E-E-A-T to the algorithms."

---

## Summary of Tone Shift

- **From:** "Efficient," "Command Center," "Orchestration" (Operational wording).
- **To:** "Survival," "Visibility," "Dominance," "Future-Proof" (Strategic wording).

**Recommendation:** Update your `localhost` Hero section immediately to test the "Don't Let AI Bury Your Brand" angle. It fits perfectly with the "Freshness" and "LLM Tracker" features we just shipped.
