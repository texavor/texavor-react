**Who does ChatGPT think is the leader in your niche?**

Traditional competitor analysis looks at backlinks and keywords. Texavor's **LLM Tracker** looks at **Brand Authority**. We query AI models to see who they cite as the "Top Experts" for your target topics.

## What is "LLM Share of Voice"?

This metric (0-100%) represents how often a competitor is cited as a primary authority by AI models for your specific niche.

- **100%:** Cited as the #1 Absolute Authority.
- **80%:** Top 3 contender.
- **20%:** Rarely mentioned or hallucinated.

## Setting Up Tracking

1.  Go to **Competitor Analysis**.
2.  **Add Domain:** Enter a competitor URL (e.g., `hubspot.com`).
3.  **Define Niche:** Tell us the topic (e.g., "Inbound Marketing").
4.  **Run Analysis:** Texavor will query current models to see where this brand ranks in their "Knowledge Graph".

## Strategic Insights

If a competitor has a high LLM Share of Voice:

- Their content is highly structured (Schema).
- They are frequently cited in "Grounding Data" (Wikipedia, high-tier documentation).
- They cover "Question keywords" comprehensively.

**How to beat them:**
Use the **AI Visibility Engine** to find the specific questions they _haven't_ answered, and write AEO-optimized content to steal that citation space.
