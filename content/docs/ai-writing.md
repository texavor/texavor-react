**You are the Pilot. The AI is the Engineer.**

Texavor's AI isn't designed to spam the internet with generic text. It's designed to unblock your technical thinking and handle the prose, so you can focus on the _Logic_.

## The Philosophy: "Human-in-the-Loop"

We believe the best content comes from **Human Insight + AI Velocity**.

- **You Provide:** The Experience, The Facts, The "Aha!" Moment.
- **AI Provides:** The Structure, The Grammar, The SEO Formatting.

## Core Tools

### 1. Slash Commands (`/`)

Trigger the Command Center anywhere in the editor.

- `/expand`: Turn a bullet point into a paragraph.
- `/shorten`: Summarize a long technical explanation.
- `/tone`: Switch between "Casual Developer" and "CTO Professional".

### 2. "Continue Writing" (`Cmd+J` / `Ctrl+Space`)

Stuck on a sentence?

1.  Place your cursor at the end of a line.
2.  Hit **Cmd+J**.
3.  The agent reads the previous 500 characters of context and suggests the next logical thought.

### 3. The "Refine" Button

Highlight any text block to see the Refine Menu:

- **Fix Grammar:** Clean up typos.
- **Simplify:** "Explain this like I'm a Junior Dev."
- **Make Assertive:** Remove passive voice ("Dependencies _should be installed_" -> "Install dependencies").

## Working with AEO Outlines

The power of Texavor comes when you combine **AEO Outlines** with **AI Writing**.

1.  **Generate Outline:** (See [AEO Outlining](/docs/aeo-outlining)).
2.  **Click "Write Section":** beside any Header.
3.  **The Context Window:** The AI looks at:
    - The H1 (Topic).
    - The specific H2 (Section Goal).
    - Your Keywords.
4.  **Result:** targeted, on-topic content that respects the structure.

## Best Practices

### ❌ Don't

- Don't generate 2,000 words in one click. (It will sound robotic).
- Don't trust the AI with specific version numbers (e.g., "React 19 release date").

### ✅ Do

- Write your own **Introduction** and **Conclusion**. (Establish _your_ voice).
- Use the AI to flesh out the "Middle" (Steps, Definitions, Comparisons).
- Always review the code snippets generated.
