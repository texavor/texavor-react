**Texavor is not a CMS. It is an Authority Engine.**

This guide explains how to navigate the interface to execute the **Intelligence -> Creation -> Deployment** loop.

![Placeholder for Screenshot: Annotated Dashboard View]

## 1. Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar is organized by _Workflow Stage_:

### 🧠 Intelligence Suite (Input)

Where you find what to write.

- **Website Auditor:** Your health check.
- **Keyword Monitor:** Your "Prompt Research" tool.
- **Competitor Analysis:** Track LLM Share of Voice.
- **Freshness Guard:** Monitor content decay.

### 📝 Creation Suite (Process)

Where you build the asset.

- **Articles:** Your master database (Drafts & Published).
- **Templates:** Saved AEO outlines.
- **Assets:** Generated thumbnails and charts.

### � Deployment (Output)

Where it goes.

- **Integrations:** Connect platforms (Dev.to, Medium).
- **Deployments:** History of push events.

## 2. The Dashboard Widget Layer

Your home screen isn't just a list of posts. It's a **Live Monitor**.

- **Freshness Alert:** "3 Articles have decayed risk > 80%."
- **Competitor Movement:** "HubSpot just overtook you for 'Inbound Marketing'."
- **Content Velocity:** "You published 4x this month (Top 10%)."

## 3. The AEO Editor

The Editor is divided into two modes:

### Focus Mode (Drafting)

Minimalist. Just you and the text.

- **Slash (`/`) commands** active.
- **AI Co-pilot (`Ctrl+Space`)** active.

### Engineer Mode (AEO)

Toggle the **"AEO Sidebar"** (Right Panel) to see:

- **Structure Check:** Are you missing a "Quick Answer"?
- **Schema Preview:** See the JSON-LD we are generating.
- **Canonical Status:** "Primary: Blog. Synced: Dev.to, Medium."

## Shortcuts Keymap

Move fast without touching the mouse.
